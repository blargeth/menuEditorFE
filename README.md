## FINAL THOUGHTS
I know the CSS is a bit basic, but the logic is present. 

I spent a bit more time than I think I'd like to admit, but keeping to MVP and time constraints, I'll submit it as is.

The sample JSON object given in the insturctions is missing a comma and has some minor inconsistencies. I made some workarounds that are purely front end focused, but I think I would deal with them on the backend to make it better.

I feel like a better overall solution requires a full stack overhaul. I have very basic experience with GraphQL, however I think with a dataset like this it would be able to use it very well. Even without graphQL, API endpoints cound be used to query Selections individually to potentially speed up rendering on the frontend. Since I used a sample object, I feel like it is a good idea to point this out.
